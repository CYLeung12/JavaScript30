      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players; //for array, the reference of payers goes to team, so when we update teams array, the original players array also updated 

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = 'Tom';

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = 'Woody';
      console.log(team4);
      console.log(players);

      // or
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      //captain.age = 29;
      //console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 15 });
      console.log(captain2);
      console.log(person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captain3 = { ...person };
      captain3.age = 40;
      console.log(captain3);
      console.log(person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,

      }

      const wes2 = Object.assign({}, wes);
      wes2.name = 'Wesley';
      //it will also update the original wes object, as Object.assign only does one-level deep of clone
      wes2.social.twitter = '@XXX';
      console.log(wes);
      console.log(wes2);

      //a cheating way to do deep clone, but not recommend
